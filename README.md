# tasks
I was assigned a set of tasks while I was applying for jobs in various companies.

I use Gitlab as a gallery for these tasks, taking advantage of its many features such as grouping projects. So, no code is included in this repository; instead, I use it as a route to Gitlab.

Here are the main tasks root on Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/users/mohammed.alyaseen/groups
