# tasks
A set of tasks have been assigned to me while I try to get a job in some company

No actual code on this repo it's only a route to Gitlab(which I personally prefer to use as a gallery for the tasks a lot of features are there like grouping projects so you can show jobs in a clear way for example tasks-2022/it-land/todo-app)

Here is the main root: https://gitlab.com/users/mohammed.alyaseen/groups
