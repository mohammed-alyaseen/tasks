# tasks
A set of tasks have been assigned to me while I try to get a job in some company

No actual code on the repo it's only a route to Gitlab(which I personally prefer to use as a gallery for the tasks a lots of features 
is there like grouping prjects so you can show tasks in clear way for example: tasks-2022/it-land/todo-app) 

Here is the main root url: https://gitlab.com/users/mohammed.alyaseen/groups
