# tasks
I was assigned a set of tasks while I was applying for jobs in various companies.

I use Gitlab as a gallery for these tasks, taking advantage of its many features, such as grouping projects.
No code is included in this repository; instead, I use it as a route to Gitlab.

Note: inside each folder in the repo there is a README.md file containing the GitLab code and the hosting link.
